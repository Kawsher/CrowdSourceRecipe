# CrowdSourceRecipe
A "CrowdSource Recipe" refers to a recipe that is gathered from a large group of people, typically online, where individuals submit their own culinary creations, allowing for a diverse collection of dishes from various backgrounds and cooking styles, essentially "crowdsourcing" the recipe pool instead of relying on a single chef or cookbook.
